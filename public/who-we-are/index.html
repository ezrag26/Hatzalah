					<div class="stack medium">
						<p>For more than 50 years, Hatzalah has been synonymous with the highest quality emergency care, delivered by dedicated EMTs and Paramedics throughout the world. Hatzalah of West Orange and Livingston is the first full-service 24/7/365 Hatzalah division in Essex County, New Jersey. It is a privilege to bring this quality and commitment to our community with the launch of Hatzalah.</p>

						<p>Our dedicated volunteer EMTs  are embedded in the community and provide free emergency medical response and the highest quality care to anyone who calls, 24 hours a day every single day of the year.</p>

						<p>Our responders are trained and certified to the highest standards, and each member is equipped with the latest emergency equipment, including lifesaving medications and automated external defibrillators (AED).</p>

						<p>We operate a proven 2-tier response system that allows us to rapidly respond to emergencies in our service area by utilizing both ambulances and first response vehicles located throughout the community.  This ensures that care begins before an ambulance arrives.</p>

				<em class="content">I came home from shul and found my wife unconscious. I called Hatzalah and they arrived within 90 seconds. The level of care and compassion they provided was remarkable. We quickly went to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a Grade 5 brain bleed and rushed to surgery. The mortality rate is 90%. My wife wouldnâ€™t be here today, having made a complete recovery, were it not for the rapid response and well-equipped Hatzalah team. <strong> - David</strong></em>
